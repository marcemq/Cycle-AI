# Cycle-AI
An Artificial Intelligence solution to recognize bottle caps colors.


## Introduction
On the last years the climate change that is affecting the earth had been increased dramatically, and this is affecting every living creature in our planet and there are many reasons why we came up to this point. One reason is that we haven't been able to recycle our waste in a efficient manner, i.e.: there are a lots of types and degree of plastic bottle caps to be recycled and because of this the process of separation is hard, and currently there are machines that do this job really good but those can be really expensive in Mexico (~500,000.00 MXN) and that's why there are few recyclers in our country that has access to these machines or do the separation almost manually. So, wee need an accessible technology to help the plastic bottle caps separation in an efficient and accessible manner. So, the Cycle-AI project is proposed.
